A website for an animal shelter called Kentucky Cares


Kentucky Cares is a pet adoption organization that helps find homes for dogs and cats in Kentucky. The main page features a welcome message to the user and filler text where a brief description about the history and purpose of the company would be. The main page also features navigation links to the dog and cats available, and to the adoption form. The dog and cat pages have pictures and descriptions of the adoptable animals. On the adoption form page the user will fill out the adoption form and submit it for consideration.



CSS Features List:

A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes with the use of media queries.


Flexbox to organize the dog and cat content areas into a single column from rows when going from desktop to mobile view.


An :nth child style on the dog and cat descriptions that selects the odd list items and highlights them by giving them a background color.



JavaScript Feature List:

The adoption form on the adoption form page contains an empty field for the user to fill out their name. An on button click function will validate the name field to see if a user has input their name. If the field is left empty the user will receive a notification that a name is required. After properly filling out the name field, the user will receive a notification that captures the value of the name field and displays it back to them.
